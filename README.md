Network Traffic Proxy System - Team 6: Byte Me -Software Engineering II - Spring 2019

The Development and Engineering Command recognizes the need to be able to modify contents of network packets. They want a system that would allow analysts to intercept and modify contents of network packets in an integrated graphical environment that supports protocols for multiple network layers.   

The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and Development and Engineering Command are collaborating to develop a Network Traffic Proxy system (NTPS) that will provide the service to intercept and the ability to modify contents of network packets via a graphical user interface.
